# Boosting Data Analytics with Synthetic Volume Expansion
Repo containing all raw codes for reproducing results from "Boosting Data Analytics with Synthetic Volume Expansion" by X.Shen, Y. Liu and R. Shen.


This repo is undergoing structural changes for better readability, but most relevant codes for reproducing results can be found in folders [tab-ddpm/syn](https://github.com/yifei-liu-stat/syn/tree/main/tab-ddpm/syn) and [conditional-aoas](https://github.com/yifei-liu-stat/syn/tree/main/conditional-aoas).


The training codes for the tabular diffusion model are mainly adapted from "TabDDPM: Modelling Tabular Data with Diffusion Models" ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15421), [code](https://github.com/yandex-research/tab-ddpm))
